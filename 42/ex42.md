1. How you made a class Game and put functions inside it.
Creating a class that encapsulates all the game behavior, the methods
are these behaviors, e.g. Game.new.play.

2. How initialize is a special initialization method that sets up important variables.
In other programming languages they call this a “constructor”, The initialize method is part
of the object-creation process in Ruby & it allows you to set the initial values for an object.

3. How you added functions to the class by nesting their definitions under the class keyword.
Adding one value of indentation.

4. How you nested the contents of the functions under their names.
The same way of nesting functions inside a class.

5. The concept of @ and how it’s used in initialize, play, and death.
I can use @ before a variable to create an instance variable, it's used in initialize
because arguments passed into initialize aren’t automatically saved anywhere.
You have to do this using instance variables.

6. How a Game was created at the end and then told to play() and how that got everything started.
Does not matter the order of the methods, the method play() calls next_room in a loop,
that's how the game start.
